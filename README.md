I have created a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements. The website features a clean and responsive design, making it accessible across different devices. It includes sections like About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact, all organized in a user-friendly layout. This project helped me strengthen my front-end development skills and demonstrate my ability to build professional and visually appealing web pages using only HTML and CSS.
